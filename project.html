  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Course Project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in class to a
    problem of your interest. I will include the papers that you need to read for the course research project together with the instructions.
    You are welcome to choose your topic provided that it is related to (some topics of) this course and nodded by me, however, as you see, a self-chosen topic seems excessive once you check the topics.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Agent-Based Modeling</strong>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mean Field Game Teory.</strong>
      The second topic is the mean-field game theory, its implication and development.

      Note: i) for this topic, knowing some PDEs may help and PDE is an extremely important role in this case.  There are quite a few areas one can work on this topic and PDE is one of them.  This will be a "hot" topic in the coming future； ii） Approaches from the Paticle Model may be carried over here.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Financial Time Series and Stochastic Approxiation</strong>
      The last project is about the time series (financial preferred) modeling, forecasting, and stochastic approximation.  Its further application can be witnessed in financial derivative pricing.
      As you will see later, SDE has a cousin in the discrete world, namely the ARCH or GARCH. You can see how the discrete and continuum families are connected in a limiting manner, and I would like you to focus more on the VG process and/or jump process, which is an realistic and practical extension to the Brownian motion.  This project is more or less like the Particle Method project, except that this one has an intrinsic focus on financial industry.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I believe each topic provides a terrific setting for you to learn several new mathematical techniques; moreover, each group would also use tools from programming languages (Python, C, Fortran, etc.) or the under-friendly software (MATLAB, Mathematica, etc.) to tackle the problems when analytical methods are lacking.  A LaTeX typing will be needed in the end.  So, a combination of team members with his/her skill/talent (focused on analysis and/or computation) would help the team engage better in this cross-disciplinary research in many ways.    </p>

  <h2>Teaming</h2>
  <p>
    Lone wolf is allowed. However, keep in mind that no merit or credit will be given just because you take further burden or more effort, and the same grading rules will be enforced.
  </p>
</div>



<div class="container sec" id="grade" style="margin-top:-50px">
  <br>
  <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
  <p>Again, as I told you at the very beginning, this is a research-oriented course.  I put 20 points for a final profesional paper and another 20 points for its profesional presentation.  Though your project result and presentation will be vital for your final grade, I will give you several chances to present/write as the course progresses, and each of you might want to cherish these practices.  Moreover, I put more weight on how you develop research attitude and taste, how you engage with the class and your peer students, how professionally you work and communicate with others, how you learn new knowledge in a timely and self-motivated manner, etc.  In simple words, the assessment is and should be all-dimensional.  The project will be assessed as a joint work,  but the members will be evaluated individually for this course.</p>
